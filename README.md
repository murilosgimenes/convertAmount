# Code Challenge

Design a currency conversion application to convert an amount from one currency to another.
You will be provided a set of currency conversion pairs. You can assume that the exchange
rates won't change very often.

## Example

```
1) Exchange rate pairs:
E.g.
CAD -> USD = 0.76158
USD -> GBP = 0.76700
CHF -> GBP = 0.84295
AUD -> EUR = 0.61175

2) Input currency
E.g. CAD

3) Output currency
E.g. USD

4) Amount to convert:
E.g. 20

Output:
20 * 0.76158 = 15.2316
```
